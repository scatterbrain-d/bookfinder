# BookFinder

BookFinder harnesses the power of the Google Books API to return book searches
by title, author, or subject. The results can be sorted, and a link to the preview
site is provided so you can start reading right away!


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
